### About upload Transports

#### DDP (WebSockets)
DDP (*Distributed Data Protocol*) build by MDG (*Meteor Dev Group*) on top of WebSockets via [SockJS](https://github.com/sockjs) library. DDP provides authentication, data standardization (*via EJSON*), and of course fallback to http, with long polling, if WebSockets is not available or not supported by browser.

The pros:

 - Persistent connection;
 - Common way for Meteor to communicate with the server.

The cons: 

 - “magic” overhead inside DDP and EJSON;
 - Only one data-transfer per time unit (*blocks other DDP requests, like methods, subs, etc.*);
 - It's synchronous.

#### HTTP (TCP/IP)
Well known way to exchange data between browser and server. To solve issue with opening connection and first-byte exchange use [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2), [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security), SSL session cache and OCSP stapling.

From [Is TLS Fast Yet](https://istlsfastyet.com/):
> Unlike HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 requires only a single connection per origin, which means fewer sockets, memory buffers, TLS handshakes, and so on.

The pros:

 - Asynchronous, unordered and simultaneous requests (*depends from browser, usually up to 10 simultaneous connections*);
 - No data-processing/encoding, we send data as it is;
 - Speed.

The cons:

 - HTTP (*Hypertext Transfer Protocol*) as you see from full name of the protocol it was initially created to transfer *hypertext*, other words HTML markup. So it was created for text-based data, not binary (*files*).


#### RTC Data Chanel (UDP)
This transport supported only in [webrtc-data-channel](https://github.com/VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files/tree/webrtc-data-channel) branch. It's in testing mode, we're waiting for community feedback, before merging to `master`. If you're interested in RTC/DC uploads, try this branch locally. Any feedback on RTC/DC usage for uploads is highly appreciated!

The pros:

 - Single socket connection;
 - Direct tunneled connection from Client to Server;
 - Pure binary data support;
 - Native implementation and support on mobile devices;
 - It's UDP.

The cons:

 - No mobile browsers support;
 - Chunk size limited to 64KB;
 - Only single stream is supported (*so, it's currently uses synchronous chunk uploads*. If `RTC/DC` will be accepted by community we will implement asynchronous chunks upload).
